# Udemy_clone
My first attempt to clone a website’s home page of udemy’s using flex concepts. 

There were totally four sections developed in this clone project those are categories section, sales section, course card section, finally wrapping up of all the contents. 

Technologies used were Hypertext markup language and cascading style sheets.

This project is completed build using the BEM principle referred as block, element and modifier.

The site is filled with more image contents, multiple sections and categories and it was nice challenge to build this site at first.
